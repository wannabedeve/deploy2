# Migrating Payload 2 Seed Data to Payload 3: post-1.ts

This document details the process of converting the `post-1.ts` seed data from a Payload 2 project to a Payload 3 project.  The primary challenges involved adapting to the changes in rich text formatting and block structures between the two versions.

## Key Differences and Findings:

* **Rich Text Structure:** Payload 2 used a simpler rich text structure, while Payload 3 utilizes Lexical, requiring a nested `root`/`children` structure for rich text content.  Directly copying the Payload 2 rich text resulted in errors.

* **Block Structures:** Payload 3 uses a more structured approach to blocks, requiring specific field names and types within each block.  The Payload 2 seed data lacked this structure, leading to rendering issues in the Payload 3 admin panel.

* **Banner Block Handling:** The `banner` block in Payload 3 requires a specific structure for its `content` field.  Initial attempts to convert the Payload 2 data resulted in errors related to the `heading` type within the banner.  The solution involved carefully matching the structure of the working "Disclaimer" banner to the "Premium Content" banner.

* **List Handling:** The Payload 2 seed data used simple `<ul>` and `<li>` structures for lists.  These were not directly compatible with the Lexical rich text editor in Payload 3.  The solution involved replacing the list structures with paragraphs containing bold text to represent the list items.

## Conversion Steps:

1. **Analyze Payload 2 Data:** The original `post-1.ts` file from the Payload 2 project was analyzed to understand its content and structure.

2. **Adapt to Payload 3 Structure:** The content was reformatted to match the nested `root`/`children` structure required by Payload 3's Lexical rich text editor.

3. **Handle Blocks:** The `banner` blocks were carefully restructured to match the working example in the project.  The `content` field within each banner block was modified to use the correct structure.

4. **Address List Issues:** The list structures were replaced with paragraphs using bold text to represent list items.

5. **Iterative Testing:** The conversion process involved iterative testing and adjustments based on feedback from the Payload 3 admin panel.  The process involved several attempts to correct the structure of the banner blocks.

## Conclusion:

Successfully migrating seed data between Payload versions requires careful attention to the differences in data structures and rich text handling.  Iterative testing and adjustments are crucial for ensuring compatibility and correct rendering in the new environment.  Understanding the specific requirements of custom blocks, such as the `banner` block, is essential for avoiding errors.  Future migrations should involve a more thorough analysis of the target version's data structures and rich text handling capabilities.
